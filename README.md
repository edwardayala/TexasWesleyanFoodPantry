## What is the Food Pantry?
Texas Wesleyan sponsors a food pantry located in the Polytechnic United Methodist Church (PUMC). The food pantry is a resource of free food and snacks available to Texas Wesleyan Students and the surrounding community. The food pantry staff log visit history and checkout history manually on paper, which becomes tedious and monotonous over time. The goal of this project is to modernize the daily duties of the food pantry volunteers and supervisors.
